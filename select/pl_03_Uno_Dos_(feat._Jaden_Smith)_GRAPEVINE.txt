(Uno, Dos, Tres, Cuatro)
Your scars show you signs
Your love's only blind when you
Lose track of time
Delay, delay the story, delay
(delay)
Away, we going away
In time I said I
Can't hold you down again,
my baby
Hold you down again, I won't
'Round again we rolling
and around again we go
I know you've grown wings
from your pain
Ay-yi-yi
I see you soarin', my love
I see you soarin', my love
I see you soarin', my love
I see you soarin', my love
My love, my love, mi amor
Your scars show you sun
Your love's only blind when you
Lose track of time
Ay-yi-yi
Ay que rabia, oh
I need time alone
(por favor)
I'll be fine I'm sure
She loped me up and on
She got me down and sedated
Hopped on my—and fellated
I know it's a bit overrated
Your better off if we waited
We're better off when we faded
She like to say we're related
Her body's a temple, it’s gated
I'm 'bout to run up
on the crib and grenade it
(whoa)
In Medellín, I need a finca
And a sexy mamacita
You look good in those Adidas
Tell the paparazzi "please stop"
And we ain't even packin heaters
Applebum like Bonita
Marinilla if you need us
She whisper "papi" like a secret
(ooh)
These white jokers
always lyin' well
Got that boss for them
that's my clientele
Man, I got a secret
I will never tell
Last one I did,
saw him die in jail
But, I'm by the pool
living hella well
Got SYRE coming
and they well aware
Then I'm on the way
straight to Delaware
Man you always winning
you should try and fail
MSFTS music, they losin'
Soarin', my love
My love, mi amor
